# Game Planning Document

## Purpose
This project is a digital adaptation of the board game *Santorini*, using Java for backend logic and a basic UI for user interaction.

## High-Level Vision
- A turn-based strategy game where players maneuver workers to construct buildings.
- Supports a variable grid size (default 5x5).
- Implements core mechanics: movement, building, worker placement, and win conditions.

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** Java Swing for UI
- **Backend:** Java (Object-Oriented approach)
- **Game Logic:** Handles movement, construction, win conditions
- **Data Handling:** File-based or simple database storage for game states

## Constraints
- No complex animations or 3D graphics
- Grid size limited to 10x10 max
- Can be variable number of players (default 2)

## Object Oriented Design 
- Must be design with consideration of object oriented principles
- Every feature s

- **Java**: Core programming language
- **Swing/AWT**: UI framework
- **JUnit**: Testing framework
- **GitHub/Git**: Version control

## Key Features
